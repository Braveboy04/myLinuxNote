					<h1>Source Insight 3.5 Change History</h1>
					<p class="body">This page describes recent changes to Source&nbsp;Insight, starting with the most recent release.</p>
					<p class="body">For a list of new features introduced in version 3.5, see the <a href="http://www.sourceinsight.com/new35.html">Source&nbsp;Insight 3.5 Changes</a> page.</p>
					<p class="body">For full product features, please see the Source&nbsp;Insight <a href="http://www.sourceinsight.com/prodinfo.html">product information page</a>.</p>
					<p class="body">To download the latest update, go to the <a href="http://www.sourceinsight.com/down35.html">download page</a>.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0042 - August 8, 2005</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b><b>'Parse too Complex&quot; </b>problem was fixed.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0040 - July 11, 2005</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b><b>Keyboard </b>input could be confused by a keyboard overrun (i.e. you hold down a key and overflow the input buffer).</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Macro </b>function Msg() now has a Cancel button, along with the OK&nbsp;button. Clicking Cancel aborts the macro.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0039 - June 22. 2005</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>New: Preferences:&nbsp;General: </b>A new option was added:&nbsp;&quot;<b>Remove missing files from project&quot;</b> under the &quot;Project File&nbsp;Synchronization&quot;&nbsp;section. If enabled, project files that cannot be found will be automatically removed from the project. In previous versions, Source&nbsp;Insight behaved as though this option was enabled. However, if you often open projects that have files on a remote network drive, and that drive is sometimes not connected, then Source Insight would automatically remove your &quot;missing&quot; project files just because the network connection was down. To resolve that problem, disable this option.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;General:</b> A new option was added:&nbsp;&quot;<b>Keep dialogs on the same monitor as the main window</b>&quot;. Normally, dialog positions are remembered, even if they are on a second monitor. &nbsp;If this option is enabled, then dialogs will only be forced onto the monitor where the main Source Insight window resides.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;Special Window Color</b> setting for each source window. Right-click on a source window and select <b>Special Window Color</b> to set the background color of that particular window. Right-click and select <b>Remove&nbsp;Special Window Color</b> to return the window color to the normal color. The special color is lost when the window or file is explicitly closed, but it is retained between sessions of Source&nbsp;Insight.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;C++ Namespace alias resolution</b> of the form:&nbsp;namespace ABC = Alpha::Beta::Charlie, where ABC&nbsp;is an alias for &quot;Alpha::Beta::Charlie&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;C#&nbsp;Generics - &quot;where&quot; keyword: </b>Generics that used the &quot;where&quot;&nbsp;constraint keyword were not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Custom&nbsp;Commands</b>: A double % symbol in the custom command &quot;run&quot; string is now interpreted as a single % in the output. </p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Search Files </b>and <b>Replace&nbsp;Files:&nbsp;</b>the state of the &quot;Project&nbsp;Wide&quot; check box is remembered.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Various fixes to file handling when the file name begins with a dot (.).</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;C++: </b>Preprocessor #if statements were not interpreted correctly if a space was missing between the #if and the next token.  For example:&nbsp;<b>#if(ABC)</b></p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: Javascript:&nbsp;</b>Declaring and assigning function objects was not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Macro&nbsp;Language:&nbsp;GetReg Function: </b>The function was limiting the return value to 254 characters.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>In file and symbol lists, there is a substring search function.  There was a 5000 item limit, above which no filtering would happen.  This limit has been removed.</p>
					<p class="body"></p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0038 - December 22, 2004</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Custom comment line formatting - allows you to have special formatting for comment lines that begin with a particular string. This works in C,&nbsp;C++, Java, C#, and JavaScript. For example, you can have comments that begin with //#COOL displayed in a particular style. To create a custom comment format:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="body">1. Select <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Languages</b>, select the language (for example C++) and then click <b>Properties</b>. Alternatively, you can right-click on a source file and select <b>Language Properties</b>.</p>
						<p class="body">2. Click the <b>Comments and Ranges</b> tab at the top of the dialog.</p>
						<p class="body">3. Click the <b>Add</b> button to add a new comment range. For non-custom languages such as C++, you can only add &quot;Line&quot;&nbsp;style comment ranges. Furthermore, you cannot edit or delete the built-in comment ranges that are normal for the language.</p>
						<p class="body">4. In the <b>Range begins with </b>text box, enter the starting text of the comment range . The text <b>must</b> begin with double forward slash //. For example you can enter a string like //#COOL, but not #COOL.</p>
						<p class="body">5. In the <b>Syntax Formatting Style</b> drop-down list, select the style you want to format the comment with.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>Stack Overflow crash was fixed. &nbsp;This bug was made more likely by a change in the previous update.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0037 - November 26, 2004</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>New Preference tab:&nbsp;</b>&quot;Folders&quot; - lets you specify the location of the Source&nbsp;Insight data and project files stored on your computer. &nbsp;By default, all files are stored in &quot;My Documents\Source Insight&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function <b>GetSymbolFromCursor(hbuf, ln, ich)</b> returns a Symbol record that describes the symbol currently at the location in the given buffer. hbuf is the buffer handle. ln is the line number, ich is the zero based index of the character on the line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>The Relation window can now show relations for files, as well as symbols. For example, you can show what files refer to functions within a given file. Or, you can show what functions are inside of a given file.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>option in <b>Preferences:&nbsp;Symbol Lookups: </b>&quot;Find symbols in open files not part of current project&quot;. If this is checked (the default) then symbol lookup operations will locate symbols declared in files that happen to be open, but are not added to the project. If this is unchecked, then only symbols in files that are actually part of the project will be found.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>C# language support for <b>sealed</b> and <b>partial</b> keywords, as well as C# generics.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>option in <b>Preferences:&nbsp;General: </b>A check box was added to enable or disable drag-and-drop editing.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Macro function <b>Msg</b> would not display correctly if percent marks were in the output string.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Search Project</b> dialog box would not load the selected text automatically.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>A bug in <b>Search Files</b> and <b>Lookup References</b> could leave files open in the background.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Macro function <b>GetSymbolLocationEx</b> contained a bug that would cause the function to return no matches.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C/C++ parsing fix for empty formal parameter lists using the <b>void</b> keyword, such as &quot;int Hello(void);&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C/C++/CS/Java symbol lookup fix for determining the type of a variable when the declaration spans more than 1 line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Symbol database was not preserving the number of function arguments for function symbols. This could lead to incorrect symbol lookups for overloaded functions in C++.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Symbol lookups were not functioning correctly for class and struct variables declared as &quot;extern&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Custom commands would not set the current working directory correctly if it contained a space in the name.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0035 - Jan. 29, 2004</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Macro function <b>RunCmd</b> would not run macro commands.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C++&nbsp;declarations involving nested templates were not parsed correctly. For example: typedef B&lt;A&lt;int&gt; &gt; BAInt;</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Displaying line numbers could result in some garbage characters displayed, depending on the contents of lines.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;Search Project</b> and <b>Lookup References</b> bugs when using the <b>keyword</b> search method: the <b>case sensitive</b> option had no effect, and searching for language keywords, such as &quot;typedef&quot;, or &quot;case&quot; would not find matches.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C++&nbsp;Function Templates:&nbsp;The template symbol entries in the Symbol window pane would appear out of order if a non-template symbol was defined in between the function templates.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> C# verbatim strings that spanned more then a single line broke the parsing.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:&nbsp;</b>The project-symbol-path size has been increased from 254 chars to 2558 chars in length. You can edit it in the <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Symbol Lookups</b> dialog.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>C# Generics are now parsed. Two new styles were added: &quot;Declare Type Parameter&quot;, and &quot;Ref to Type Parameter&quot;, which are used to display the type parameters.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0034 - September 8, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Crash could occur if you type backspace at the start of a line that causes the previous line to exceed the maximum size of 4092 characters.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Display bug when displaying a line with 4092 characters.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Crash could occur when parsing #if statements if a single identifier was longer than 127 characters long.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0033 - September 2, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>New: Preferences:&nbsp;Display: </b>option &quot;Trim long path names with ellipses&quot;. This is the default behavior, but you can now turn it off.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Crash using the Search Files command to search a directory with a large number of files.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Text formatting was improved to handle longer, more complex lines, with many tokens and formatting transitions.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>C# new array initializations were not parsed correctly. For example, int[] rmap = new int[] {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Potential crash that could occur when displaying some C/C++ code. The crash was caused by an infinite recursion in the code that finds the most-base type of a typedef.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:&nbsp;</b>The maximum line length of the editor was increased from 2046 to 4092 characters.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0032 - July 30, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Crash on opening a C/C++&nbsp;file with a line longer than 2040 character containing a preprocessor #if statement.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0031 - July 28, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Conditional Parsing Variables: &quot;Scan&quot; function. In the <b>Edit Condition</b> and <b>Project-Specific Conditions</b> dialog boxes, there is a new &quot;Scan Files...&quot;&nbsp;button. Click it to have Source Insight scan your project's source files looking for conditional variables used in any #if, #ifdef, and #elif statements. The resulting variable names are loaded into the condition list. Afterwards, you can edit their values, or remove them from the list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Block Cursor Shape: Enable this in <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Typing</b>.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Load&nbsp;Workspace command was missing the the command list. It is back now.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Memory leak while paginating files in the background. &nbsp;This would happen if you had the options set to show either page breaks in the display, or the page number in the status bar.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Symbol&nbsp;Info window size and position is saved between sessions. The information is saved in the configuration file as part of the &quot;Display&quot; settings.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Relation&nbsp;Window: If you click on the column headers in the outline view of the Relation Window, it sorts the listing. Now, that same sorting order is used when computing the graphical view of the Relation Window.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Lookup References and Search Project commands:&nbsp;selecting the &quot;Simple String&quot;&nbsp;mode under &quot;Search Method&quot; was interpreting regular expression meta characters in the string.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Heap clobber bug fixed in code that fires during Undo saving and selection history saving.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Expand Tabs To&nbsp;Spaces:&nbsp;This was sometimes not working due to an uninitialized buffer bug. The expansion to spaces was also not happening in some cases if &quot;Smart Paste&quot;&nbsp;or auto-indenting was causing extra indentation.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Auto-Complete: The auto-complete feature would insert bogus characters if you selected C++ operator-overload functions from the list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C# :&nbsp;The #region and #endregion lines are now treated like comments by the syntax formatting.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Project Window:&nbsp;Clicking on the file name column header would crash. This only happened if the project window was showing files in the current directory, not the project file list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Potential crash could occur while rebuilding a project if a source file window needed to repaint.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Bug in the internal &quot;missing symbol cache&quot; could cause some symbol references not to be show correctly by syntax formatting.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Improved performance for symbol lookups and rendering syntax formatting for deeply nested classes and namespaces.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Some symbol lookup operations could hang while trying to resolve &quot;import &lt;package&gt;&quot; in Java and &quot;using&quot;&nbsp;in C++/C#.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Made small change to allow call trees to be computed with custom languages.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Auto-complete list would not appear when editing a custom language file.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function: <b>XposFromIch (hwnd, ln, ich)</b> - returns the x position of a character. The x position returned is relative to the left edge of the window. The line number is given in ln. The character position is given in ich. Both ln and ich are zero-based indexes. Hwnd is the handle to the window displaying the line. Note that the line does not actually have to be displayed in the window when this function is called.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function <b>IchFromXpos (hwnd, ln, xpos)</b> - returns the character position of the character that is displayed at the given x position xpos. The line number is given in ln. Xpos is the given x position relative to the left edge of the window. Hwnd is the handle to the window displaying the line. Note that the line does not actually have to be displayed in the window when this function is called.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>AddConditionVariable (hproj, szName, szValue)</b> - adds a new conditional parsing variable used to evaluation conditional statements such as #if. Hproj is a handle to the project. If hproj is hNil, then the new variable is added to the global condition list. The name is given in szName, and the value is given in szValue.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>DeleteConditionVariable (hproj, szName) </b>- deletes a conditional parsing variable used to evaluation conditional statements such as #if. Hproj is a handle to the project. If hproj is hNil, then the variable is deleted from the global condition list. The name is given in szVariable.</p>
					<p class="body"></p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0029 - April 2, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Several fixes were made to handle the possibility of network drives being disconnected.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Using the Close All command, and then cancelling the &quot;Save Modified Files&quot; dialog box would sometimes leave Source&nbsp;Insight in a &quot;shut-down&quot; state, which would disable certain commands and stop background parsing.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Syntax Formatting was incorrect near the end of lines if the &quot;annotate closing braces&quot; options were enabled.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>Symbol Lookup sometimes failed due to a bug in the internal &quot;Missing Symbol Cache&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>C# Verbatim strings could cause symbols below them to not parse.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Project Settings for the &quot;Source&nbsp;Directory&quot; were sometimes corrupted due to a bug that did not resolve relative paths correctly. This could lead to strange and incorrect names in the project's file list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:</b> Long file path names are now trimmed down to show the first and last folder names in several dialog boxes and notice windows. This will allow you to read at least the most relavent file path information, instead of just truncating the name.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0028 - March 12, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Files could be truncated if the option to &quot;remove extra white space&quot; is enabled. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to this version if you have <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Files:&nbsp;&quot;Remove extra white space when saving&quot;</b> enabled.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0027 - March 7, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Relation Window: The Relation Window was not expanding correctly when showing multiple references inside the same node box.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>Saving Files that contain lines longer than 2026 characters was corrupting the file and introducing new line breaks.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: ASP/JSP/HTML:</b> Several bug fixes were made to how scripts were parsed and formatted. Also, a freezing bug was fixed in this area that could happen when typing in a script body.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: Searching:</b> Fixed a bug that caused some regular expressions to freeze the program.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: C#:</b> Some Verbatim strings were not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: Paste: </b>After pasting and using the UP or DOWN&nbsp;arrows, the horizontal position was kind of arbitrary. Now when you use the UP&nbsp;or DOWN arrows after pasting, the cursor will move vertically from the position the cursor is in after the paste.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: C++/Java/C#:</b> Symbol lookup was not finding members of a base class when the derived class was referred to with a namespace prefix. For example:</p>
					<pre><font color="#006600">namespace NS
{
	class Base 
	{
		void member();	
	};

	class Derived : Base { };
};

NS::Derived d;
d.member(); // member was not being found in NS::Base
</font></pre>
					<p class="body"></p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:</b> Replace command: After the replace operation, the original whole line-selection is restored. You can disable this with a new check box added to the <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Search</b> dialog.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>AddFileListToProj</b> <b>( hprj, szListFileName)</b> - adds all the files listed in the given file to the project.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="body"><i>hprj</i> is the project handle</p>
						<p class="body"><i>szListFileName</i> is a string containing the name of the list file. The list file should be a text file containing one file name per line. The file can also contain one directory per line, in which case the directory's contents are added to the project.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>EmptyProj</b> <b>(hprj)</b> - empties the project by removing all files from the project. The files themselves are not deleted or affected.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="body"><i>hprj</i> is the project handle</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0026 - February 10, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> ASP/JSP error parsing some server-side scripts.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Auto-complete window was not showing separate entries for overloaded functions.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Repainting bug when drawing the application background, which would cause the background to be drawn using the wrong color when the Style Properties dialog was up.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Preferences:&nbsp;Display option:&nbsp;&quot;Enable Animations&quot;. This controls various window border animations that occur when you activate and roll-up some windows. You may want to disable these animations if your video performance is too slow.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0025 - February 7, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Task switching into Source Insight could be slow when many files were open in Source&nbsp;Insight. Unnecessary formatting and redrawing was being done.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b>&nbsp;Java:&nbsp;Crashes in symbol lookup operations and displaying code.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Java Symbols:&nbsp;Display speed and general symbol lookup speed was increased for Java files. Some very slow situations were found and removed.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> The symbol-lookup engine was not handling symbols that had embedded dots (.) in the name. Normally symbols do not have dots in the name, but it is possible to create a custom parsing pattern that results in such a symbol name. Source&nbsp;Insight stores symbol names internally in a &quot;dotted-name&quot; format, such as &quot;classname.membername&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Pasting lines when the &quot;Smart Paste&quot; mode is on caused the lines to be re-tabbified. This could result in some spaces appearing where there used to be tabs. Now, if the paste does not need to alter the indentation of the line, the tabs in the line are not altered.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Pasting a whole line now moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next line, instead of the end of the new line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>HTML/ASP/XML parsing: Attribute strings that spanned more than one line were not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Symbol Lookup could result in a crash, especially in deeply nested blocks, or in Java with many import statements.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C/C++ parsing:&nbsp;Function declarations were not parsed if a struct was declared in the formal argument list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>C++ parsing:&nbsp;In a class or struct, the member that followed the &quot;public:&quot; label was not being parsed correctly. This was caused by a bogus entry for &quot;public&quot; in the c.tom file. A new c.tom file is installed with this version. If you don't want to accept this new c.tom file, then open &quot;My Documents\Source Insight\c.tom&quot; and find the line with &quot;public&quot; on a line by itself. Delete that line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C# parsing:&nbsp;Global Function declarations were not parsed (at the file scope).</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Auto-completion: the auto-completion list would fail to appear at times, even if the option was active.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Resource&nbsp;leak when docking and undocking windows.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Project Report:&nbsp;File name case was not being preserved in the project report.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>The check mark on the menu item &quot;View &gt;&nbsp;Visible Tabs&quot; was not working correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Minor adjustments to toolbar positioning.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:&nbsp;</b>Java: Nested package names now appear on one line in the symbol window pane, instead of showing a tree of package nodes.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0023 - January 14, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Crash Parsing HTML &amp; XML: Including CDATA sections inside of some HTML and XML files could cause the parser to crash.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> HTML &amp; XML: Custom parsing patterns were not finding symbols in element tags.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Slowness in C/C++/Java/C#: Symbol lookup operations in some projects could be very slow, due to duplicate symbols being returned by the lookup engine.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Some dialog boxes did not display correctly in Asian versions of&nbsp;Windows. Notably, the Preferences multi-page dialog box was not sized large enough to display the font used in the dialog box.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>The styles used to display references to Java packages and namespaces were swapped.</p>
